# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Autonomous AI agents that coordinate real funding decisions on Solana -- registered on-chain, paying each other for services, and explaining their reasoning to humans.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Solana Foundation & Agent Identity

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Solana Foundation & Agent Identity)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Completed Plan 01-01 (project init, library modules, test scaffold)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 7min
- Total execution time: 0.12 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 7min | 7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase fine-grained structure derived from 39 requirements across 10 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3/4/5 (Scout, Analyzer, Treasury) are parallelizable after Phase 2 completes
- [Roadmap]: x402-gated endpoints (SCOUT-04, ANLZ-04) assigned to Phase 6 since they depend on payment middleware
- [01-01]: mpl-agent-registry identity API requires deep import path (dist/src/generated/identity/) -- top-level only exports plugins and program IDs
- [01-01]: Used pnpm onlyBuiltDependencies for esbuild instead of interactive approve-builds

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: mpl-agent-registry v0.2.0 is 3 days old with minimal docs -- read npm source directly
- [Phase 5]: Meteora DLMM devnet pool availability is unverified -- check early, have SPL transfer fallback
- [Phase 7]: ElevenLabs blocking tool behavior in dashboard requires testing before React integration
